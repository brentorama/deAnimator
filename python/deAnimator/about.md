DeAnimator, just kill the animation.  

This tool will kill all the animation found within rigs identified in the scene.  If you wish to add additional aniamted objects to the list, do so by selecting a root node and hitting the plus button.

Hit execute with nothing selected to kill animation on everything in the list - or, choose just certain items from the list to DeAnimate.

If you've added or removed items to the list and want to revert to just rigs, hit the refresh button on the left.  By default, rigs will not load if they contain no animation.

If you want to test what the tool will do without affecting your scene, turn on dryrun and verbose before hitting execute (the checkmark at the bottom right), then check the script editor for a detailed printout.
